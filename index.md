## 🛠 Getting Started — Creating a Thai Store Account  

Some apps in this guide are **only available in the Thai App Store or Google Play Store**.  
To access them, you may need to switch or create a Thai account.

1. Open **Settings** → tap your name → **Media & Purchases** → **Sign Out**.  
2. Create a new Apple ID at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/){:target="_blank"}.  
3. When asked for a region, select **Thailand**.  
4. You'll need a Thai address — you can use your hotel, condo, or a coworking space.  
5. Once logged in with the Thai Apple ID, you'll be able to download Thai-only apps.  
   *(Tip: you can switch back to your original Apple ID anytime.)*  

### 🤖 Android (Google Play)  
1. Open the **Google Play Store** app.  
2. Go to **Menu → Account → Country and profiles**.  
3. Select **Thailand** as your country.  
4. Add a Thai payment method (or sometimes just a Thai SIM card).  
5. Once changed, you'll see Thai-exclusive apps in the Play Store.  
   *(Note: You can only change your Play country once per year, so many expats create a second Gmail account just for Thailand.)*
